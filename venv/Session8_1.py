# Session 8
# Problem 1: Advanced Counter Class

""" STATEMENT: Implement an advanced counter class. It can keep track of the quantity of each item
swiped and the price of a unit. See the pattern you must follow on the left and the example of
how it will be used and tested below.

It is probably best to use a dictionary with string keys and list values for the implementation,
but such details are up to you.

TESTS:

See #Test1, #Test2, â€¦ in Statement """

class Counter:

        self._items += amount
        self._total += amount * price_of_unit

#implement this method;
#item_name is string, amount is integer, price of unit is float
#adds amount of items with item_name and specifies price_of_unit
#you may assume that every addition for the same item_name will set
#the same price_of_unit

#number of previously added items with this name, remove the record
#associated with item_name;
